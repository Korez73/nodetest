# Introduction

This material is a result of going thru the following course  
[node js for c sharp developers](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/node-js-for-c-sharp-developers)  
  

## Learning my way along the way 
Along the way, I needed to learn about modules and some updates in node and js world since this course was published.  
- [How to Create a Node and Babel Project w VS Code](https://carldesouza.com/how-to-create-a-node-and-babel-project-using-visual-studio-code/)
- Note: `npm install cross-env` to deal with ./ 'not recognized problems in Windows.  For example
`cross-env npx babel src --out-dir .compiled --source-maps --watch`  
- [VS Code NodeJS Debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging?ref=labnotes.org)


### Other Learnings  
In package.json, this time when I npm init'd it, it had this in there before I updated it to Jasmine (testing framework)  
`"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"`  
  
Gulp has upgraded since this course, of course  
[Gulp Task Definitions with Prereqs](https://codeburst.io/switching-to-gulp-4-0-271ae63530c0)  
[Gulp Async Completions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36897877/gulp-error-the-following-tasks-did-not-complete-did-you-forget-to-signal-async)
